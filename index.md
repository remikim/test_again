Shanya served as the Project Manager for particular project, while also having a hand in coordinating publicity and other miscellaneous assets. After graduation, she plans to travel during summer, and will begin her job search when she returns in the fall. Shanya hopes to utilize the skills and attributes used in her studies at UCLA to pursue a career in public relations and marketing in the Los Angeles area.

He will be graduating from the University of California Los Angeles in June 2016 in Sociology and a Digital Humanities minor. In his free time, he enjoys dancing, cold brew coffee, wake surfing and hiking. For this project, he served as both the publicity coordinator and one of the web designers. He plans to utilize the skills he attained from UCLA’s Digital Humanities coursework (including in this project) in his postgraduate plans, as he pursues a career in digital marketing and digital media planning.

**Hanna Girma**
Hanna is studying World Arts and Cultures (WAC) at UCLA, with a minor in Digital Humanities (DH). She studies Non-Western counter narratives, focusing mainly on community-based arts activism, studies of visual culture, and critical ethnographies. As a DH minor, she is interested in the cultural and social impacts of new media and information technologies. For her senior thesis she is curating a show at As It Stands titled Lost Wax, featuring black female artists who re-appropriate, or re-cast, imagery that has been historically weaponized against non-normative bodies. She was the web designer for this project.

**Karla Contreras**
Karla is a 4th year, Applied Linguistics and Spanish Community and Culture double major and Digital Humanities minor.  Karla was the metadata specialist for this project. She is currently employed at UCLA Housing’s IT department. Her post grad plan is to land a full time job in a technical or entertainment business. After a year gap she will be striving to obtaining an MBA on a graduate level.

**Monica Berry**
Monica is a 3rd year, World Arts and Cultures major and Digital Humanities minor. She focused on creating data visualizations for this project with the hopes of making our data more accessible.  Monica plans to continue her studies in both departments at UCLA before her early graduation next winter.

**Aya Grace Yoshioka**
Aya is a 4th year, Sociology major and Digital Humanities minor. Aya focused on web design and publicity for this project. She is currently a marketing intern for Awaken Arts, a non-profit organization, and is a New Student Advisor for UCLA’s New Student and Transition Programs.

As a digital humanist, she is particularly interested in the visualization of large bodies of data from cultural heritage institutions, and the application of digital methods to the analysis of images and video. She is very proud to work with such talented students.

## About the Project- main tab
We are a group of undergraduate and graduate students in the **Digital Humanities program** at the University of California, Los Angeles. This main goal of this project was to collaboratively create a database on early African-American silent race films by drawing together information in a **wide range of primary and secondary sources.** For the purpose of this project, we determined that we would only include silent films created before 1930 for African-American audiences. This definition was the main factor that informed our decisions to include or exclude pieces of data. (You can read more about how we arrived at our definition **here.**)

The **database** we have created contains information on films, actors, production companies, and other aspects of early silent-era African American race films. The database is intended to allow the public to learn about this period in film history that is too rarely discussed.

As we compiled the database, we began to see connections within our dataset. We created **data visualizations** based on these connections in an attempt to give the audience a more complete understanding of the complexity of this early African-American film industry. It is our hope that individuals will be able to utilize this database for their own research on this topic.  We have targeted our database towards scholarly research. However, we hope that the information within this project is accessible to a wide range of audiences who are interested in the early African American film industry.

We have structured our dataset so that it is free to use by individuals for their own research and knowledge.  Each data visualization we have included is accompanied by the specific data used and step by step instructions on how to create similar visualizations.We hope that this project increases interest in this part of history that is too rarely discussed.  The early African-American film industry gives us insight into multiple facets of history, and it is our hope that this project will prompt others continue to explore its significance.
